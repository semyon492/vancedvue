# Footer

Use the footer section at the bottom of every page to show valuable information to your users, such as sitemap links, a copyright notice, and a logo

The footer is one of the most underestimated sections of a website being located at the very bottom of every page, however, it can be used as a way to try to convince users to stay on your website if they haven’t found the information they’ve been looking for inside the main content area.

## Default footer

Use this footer component to show a copyright notice and some helpful website links.
