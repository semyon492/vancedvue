Welcome and thanks to use and contribute to this project. Your support is very important.

If you found any problem / bug during the use of vancedvue lib, or have any suggestions that can make this lib better, please [create an issue](https://github.com/suralabs/vancedvue/issues/new). 

Pull requests are also welcome! However, before you started working on a PR, it is highly recommend to **create an issue with your idea first**, so people can know what's going to happen and avoid duplicated work. After that, pls make PRs to branch:

1. `dev`: latest branch, targeting Vue.js 3.x for now
2. `1.x`: targeting Vue.js 2.x
3. `0.x`: targeting Vue.js 2.x (not maintained anymore, use 1.x instead)
